2. Platform independent:
                        java is platform independent and programming language.
                        java is used as software based and hardware based runtime environment in java platform.
                        java project executed in runtime environment.
                        Compiler is used to convert from java code to byte code.
                        Write Once Run Anywhere(WORA).
3.JVM,JRE AND JDK:
                   1)JVM:
                        JVM  (Java Virtual Machine) is Abstract Machine .JVM is used as Software based and Hardware based                               runtime environment.
                            
                        JVM is Compiled convert from java code to byte code.
                        it is also Write Once Run Anywhere(WORA).
                   2)JRE:
                         JRE(Java Runtime Environment)is also runtime environment and it contains library files and other                             files in java .
                  3)JDK:
                         JDK(Java Development Kit) is also runtime environment.it contains set of files and JRE and development kit in java.
4.Is Pointer available in java?
                 Pointer does not available in java.Pointer is similar datatypes
5.Is Multiple inheritance available in java?
                            Mutiple inheritance does not available in java.it is used only through inheritance in outside class.
6.Package:
             Package is grouping of elements such as Classes,Methods,interfaces,Variables etc,..
7.Naming Conventions:
               Naming Convention is a rule you  what name decide such as interfaces,Variables,Methods,Classes.
8.Access Modifiers:
                  There are two types .
                  1)Access Modifiers
                  2)Non-access Modifiers
       1)Access Modifires:
                         Public:
                        Private:

                        Default:
      Public:
             it is accessible anywhere such as classes,Packages,Methods,Sub classes.
      Private:
             it is accessible within  class but out side package through inheritance only.
      Prodect:
             it is accessible within Package only.
      Default:
              it is accessible Particular package only.
        2)Non-access Modifiers:
                              Static,Abstract etc,..
