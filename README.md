9.Data Types:
          There are two datatypes
          1)Primitive Datatypes
          2)Non-Primitive Datatypes
          
          
          1)Primitive Datatypes:
           int
           sort
           long
           double
           float
           char
           boolean
           
           
           2)Non-Primitives:
           Array
           String
           
10.Variable:
                      Variable is name of Memory Location
                      
                      Three Types
                      1)Local
                      2)Instance
                      3)Static
                      
                  1) Local:
                           it is declared inside the method is known as Local Variable.
                  
                  2) Instance:
                              it is declared inside the class but outside the method is known as Instance Variable.
                              
                  3)Static:
                           it is declared Static is known as Static Variabe.
                                      
11.While and do while:
        
        while(boolean expression)
        {
        
        }
        
        
        do while:
        
              do
              :
              {
              
              }while(boolean expression)
              
              
  12.for Loop:
            
            for(Intialization;operator;declaration)
            {
            
            }
            
            
  13.Object:
  
              Object is a entity.That has State and Behaviour is known as Object.
              
              Syntax:
                         Classname Referance Variable=new Classname();
                         
  14.Class:
  
           Class is a Collection of Objects.Its a logical entity.
           
           Class Simlple()
           {
           
           public static void main(String args[])
           {
           
           }
           }
           
15.Polymorphism:
 
          When One task is Performed by different ways is Known as Polymorphism.
          
          it has two types.
           They are,
           1)Function Overloading
           2)Function Overriding
           
16.Function Overloading:
                        it has  Same name and Diffrerent Arguments is known as Function Overloading.
                        
              Example:
                   
                       Class Student
                       {
                       int id.no;
                       public void sum(int a,int b)
                       {
                       System.out.println(a+b);
                       }
                       public void sum(int a,int b,int c)
                       {
                       System.out.println(a+b+c);
                       }
                       public static void main(String args[])
                       {
                       Student s=new Student();
                       s.sum(5,10);
                       s.sum(15,20,25);
                       }
                       }
                       
                       
                       
17.Function Overriding:

                         it has Same name,different arguments and different classes is known as Function Overriding.
                         
                         Example:
                         ClassA
                         {
                         int id;
                         String name;
                         String address;
                         {
                         ClassB extends A
                         {
                         
                         }
                         }
                         }
                         
                         
18.Inheritance:
                    
                    When one task acquires all the  Properties and behaviours of Parent object is Known as Inheritance.
                    
                   Example:
                   ClassA
                   {
                   
                   
                   ClassB implements ClassA
                   {
                   
                   }
                   }
